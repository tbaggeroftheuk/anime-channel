    "description": "This application primarily simulates an electronic device for the calculation of biorhythms. Users can have a momentary value of mental, emotional and physical curves calculated and their diagrams displayed or ascertain their values for any given date. This application also allows them to determine a percentage of partnership harmony and contains a hidden game as a bonus.\n<p>\nBiorhythm models use three cycles: a 23-day \"physical\" cycle, a 28-day \"emotional\" cycle, and a 33-day \"intellectual\" cycle. Each of these cycles varies in a sine wave pattern between high and low extremes, with days where the cycle crosses the zero line described as \"critical days\" of greater risk or uncertainty.",
