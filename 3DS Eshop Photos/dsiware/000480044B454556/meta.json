    "description": "Dive into a unique audio-visual\nexperience where technology meets\nart. Created by multimedia musician\nToshio Iwai, Electroplankton are living\naquatic 'instruments' that you interact\nwith to produce a variety of sounds\nand images limited only by your\nimagination!<br>\n<br>\nThe fish-like Rec-Rec feed on sound\nwaves, which they digest and then\nrepeat back at perfect intervals,\nmaking them perfect for reproducing\nany sounds you like. They swim in\nschools of four; their frequency\nchanges depending on how fast they\nswim.<br>\n<br>\nUse Performance mode to create\nyour own unique compositions, or\nrelax with Audience mode and let the\nElectroplankton run wild.<br>\n<br>\nPlease note that elements of this\nsoftware may have been featured in\npreviously-released software.",
