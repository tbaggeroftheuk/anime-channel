Blast everything in sight as the aliens attack with rush attacks, stealth attacks, swarms, and tracker beams, surrounding you from all directions.\n<br><br>Recruit partnership ships to help you fend off the invaders or team up with a friend using DS Wireless Communications. Hold off the hordes of aliens while your mothership recharges its warp drive in a series of steps that edge you closer to earth, where the final battle awaits.",
