    "description": "He’s a small bird with a very long\ntongue and an insatiable appetite for\nbeans. Luckily for Pyoro, beans drop\nconstantly from the sky. However, if\nPyoro lets a bean fall, it breaks a hole\nin the ground that he can’t cross.<br>\n<br>\nThis fast-paced action game requires\nskill and strategy to snatch all the\nbeans you can, while dodging the\nones you can’t and making sure you\ndon't get trapped! The higher in the\nsky that you grab a bean, the more\npoints it will be worth.<br>\n<br>\nPlus – if you master Pyoro, you can\nunlock the even faster-paced Pyoro 2!\nIn this game, you can spit seeds at\nhigh speed to bring down more beans\nthan ever before!<br>\n<br>\nPlease note that elements of this\nsoftware may have been featured in\npreviously-released software.",
