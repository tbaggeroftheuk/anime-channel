    "description": "Enjoy a traditional game of nine-ball\npool against a computer, or against a\nfriend using a single Nintendo DSi,\nwhile listening to smooth jazz in Jazzy\nBilliards. Both opponents must hit the\nballs on the table in ascending order,\nworking their way to the ninth ball,\nand whoever can sink the nine-ball\nfirst will take the win.<br>\n<br>\nJazzy Billiards features an intuitive\ncontrol scheme that takes full\nadvantage of the Nintendo DSi stylus\nand touch screen, and also simulates\nrealistic collision physics between the\nballs. Simply point in the direction you\nwant to hit the cue ball, aim, then use\nthe stylus to pull back the cue and hit\nthe ball. The strength of the cue ball\ncan be adjusted by how far back and\nhow hard the player draws back and\nstrikes with the cue.",
