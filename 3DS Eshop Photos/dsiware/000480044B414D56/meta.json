    "description": "Spread your wings with this\nirresistibly simple action game for one\nor two players! Simply manoeuvre the\npaper plane through a winding\ncourse - and don't collide with the\nobstacles. But that's easier said than\ndone!<br>\n<br>\nIn Endless Mode, the longer you\nsurvive through the\nrandomly-generated course, the\nhigher your score. Or try Time Attack\nMode to complete special courses as\nquickly as possible.<br>\n<br>\nYou can also play together with a\nfriend in Race Mode. Each player\ntakes one side of the Nintendo DSi\nsystem to control and race with their\nown paper plane!<br>\n<br>\nPlease note that elements of this\nsoftware may have been featured in\npreviously-released software.",
