    "description": "Experience a piece of Nintendo history with the Game & Watch series for Nintendo DSiWare. Each title is a perfect recreation of a classic LCD game from the early 1980s, including normal Game A and alternate Game B modes.<br>\n<br>\nAnd no Game & Watch title would be complete without the \"Watch\" function - each title includes a fully functional clock.<br>\n<br>\nFlagman will challenge your memory and reflexes, as you try and remember a series of numbers in quick succession. In Game A, memorise the Flagman's sequence shown on his flags and on the bottom of his feet, within a set time. In Game B, repeat the number shown one at a time, but do it quickly!",
