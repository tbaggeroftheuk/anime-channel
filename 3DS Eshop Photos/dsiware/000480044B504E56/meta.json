    "description": "The ever-popular Puzzle League\ncomes to Nintendo DSiWare! Like all\ngood puzzlers, the concept is simple:\nconnect blocks of the same colour to\nclear them from the screen, and\nprevent your stack from becoming too\nhigh.<br>\n<br>\nThere are four single player modes to\nchoose from: Endless (survive to earn\na top score), Clear (eliminate all\nblocks above the line), Score Attack\n(score as high as possible in two\nminutes), and Vs. COM (use items and\ncombos to attack a computer\nopponent).<br>\n<br>\nYou can choose from a variety of\nbackground music to get you ‘in the\nzone’, and even play in horizontal or\nvertical mode, holding the Nintendo\nDSi normally or like a book.\nWhichever way you play, you’re\nguaranteed maximum fun!<br>\n<br>\nPlease note that elements of this\nsoftware may have been featured in\npreviously released software.",
