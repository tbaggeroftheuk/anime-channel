    "description": "Spin Six is a puzzle game guaranteed\nto bring a new twist to the genre. It’s\nall about rotating number panels to\nmake horizontal or vertical lines of the\nsame number to clear them from the\nboard. While that sounds simple, the\nchallenge lies in your ability to make\nchains of number panels to score even\nbigger points.<br>\n<br>\nThere are four unique game modes,\neach with various skill levels. Puzzle\nmode brings you nearly 200 puzzles,\nsplit into One-Turn or Chain\ncategories, or you can challenge your\npanel elimination skills in Time Attack\nmode. Pit yourself against a time limit\nin Score Attack mode, (use the\nSpinnerator to get into Fever Time and\nreally boost your score!), while Chain\nChallenge is about making as many\nchains as you can in one go.<br>\n<br>\nWith easy to master, but deep\ngameplay, it’s about time you gave\nSpin Six a whirl!",
