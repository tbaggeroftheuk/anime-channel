Your mission is simple: get\nthe highest score possible, across\neight phases of fierce\nvertical-scrolling action.<br>\n<br>\nChoose from two powerful craft: Red\nOrion and Blue Nova, tailored for\nnovice or experienced players.

You can also view replays of\ntop-ranking players’ games and learn\nfrom the best!",
