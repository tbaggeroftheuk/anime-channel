Adjusting the pressure and current levels as well as feeding the species will be part of their well-being.\n<br><br>\nAfter some time, on your own you will be able to discern what kind of fish tank can support such species, species that can't cohabit together and much more in order to breed your species.\n<br><br>\nThen your fishes will live longer and even be able to reproduce!\n",
