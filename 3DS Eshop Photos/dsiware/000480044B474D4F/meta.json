    "description": "Experience a piece of Nintendo history with the Game & Watch series for Nintendo DSiWare. Each title is a perfect recreation of a classic LCD game from the early 1980s, including normal Game A and alternate Game B modes.<br>\n<br>\nAnd no Game & Watch title would be complete without the \"Watch\" function - each title includes a fully functional clock.<br>\n<br>\nManhole is a hectic game in which you must plug holes in the street. Using only one manhole cover, move quickly from hole to hole, and hold the cover in place as the pedestrians cross. You lose a life for any people that fall into the sewer. Game B challenges you at a faster pace.",
