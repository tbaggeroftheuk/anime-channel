    "description": "A strange electronic sea awaits you. In this sea, you’ll encounter unique species of tiny Electroplankton that respond to your touch and voice to create unforgettable sounds and melodies. Enjoy getting to know these fascinating plankton as you relax to their sights and sounds!\n\nNanocarp have very sensitive hearing. Sensing vibrations coming through water with the two ears on their head, these plankton can distinguish sound quality and frequency. They display very interesting reactions to the sound of humans clapping and breathing. Nanocarp are also excellent swimmers. They have a tendency to swim in formations of sixteen and react together to sound they detect. These plankton emit sounds on their own when they sense waves on the water’s surface. When this happens, the pitch of sounds they produce changes depending on where the Nanocarp is currently located.\n\n",
