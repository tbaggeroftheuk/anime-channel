    "description": "All stars and planets in the cosmos eventually come to an end!\n<br><br>\nSolar System, 2037.\n<br><br>\nAn asteroid as large as the moon is headed directly towards Earth.\n<br><br>\nImminent Forecast: Total Destruction!!!\n<br><br>\nThe human race will face its Armageddon, unless you can stop it.\n<br><br>\nThere is no weapon powerful enough to destroy or even divert it from its Earth-bound trajectory. Only an amount of energy greater than what our sun produces could prevent it. That magnitude of energy is located outside of our solar system, at the 4 cardinal points of the galaxy. At those coordinates are the planets: Upsil-on, Magnet-on, Fusi-on and Dark-on.\n<br><br>\nVisit each planet to collect the greatest amount of energy and the mission will be a complete success. Humanity will die out some day, but not this time! Be brave! It's in your hands to prevent it! \n<br><br>\nFeatures:\n<br><br>\n32 levels (4 planets with 8 levels each)<br>\nRunner playability<br>\nTouch control and easy handling<br>\nAmazing, innovative graphics<br>\nLocal ranking",
