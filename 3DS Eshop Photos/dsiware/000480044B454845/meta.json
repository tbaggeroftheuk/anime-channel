    "description": "A strange electronic sea awaits you. In this sea, you’ll encounter unique species of tiny Electroplankton that respond to your touch and voice to create unforgettable sounds and melodies. Enjoy getting to know these fascinating plankton as you relax to their sights and sounds!\n\nResembling delicate snow crystals, Marine-Crystal plankton elegantly float on the surface of the water. The plankton get their name from their distinctive snowflake shape. They grow in clusters of 35 and line up in very orderly formations. When stimulated, Marine-Crystal plankton spin and produce vibrant sounds. While the plankton do grow in size if they are repeatedly tapped, they gradually return to their original size over time. They are born in four polygonal shapes: triangle, square, pentagon, and hexagon. The ends of the crystalline protrusions also take on the same shapes. The tone of the sound they make changes depending on the shape of the Marine-Crystal plankton’s body.\n",
