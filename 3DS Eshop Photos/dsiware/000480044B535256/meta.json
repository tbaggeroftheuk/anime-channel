    "description": "Meet gaming's newest 'star'!\nAura-Aura has fallen from the sky and\nlanded on Earth, and only you can\nreturn him to his home in the heavens.<br>\n<br>\nUse Aura-Aura's grapple arm to\nswing from grapple points floating in\nthe clouds and reach the highest\npossible altitude before the timer runs\nout. You'll find a variety of helpful\nitems on your way up, such as grapple\narm extensions and bombs that blast\nyou upwards. Watch out for the many\nenemies and hazards, though, and try\nnot to fall; it's a long way down!<br>\n<br>\nThere are two play modes to choose\nfrom: Score Attack and Endless\nMode. In Score Attack, your aim is to\nreach each goal with as many points\nas possible. In Endless Mode, you\nhave to climb as high as you can\nwithin a set time limit.<br>\n<br>\nWith gameplay that's simple yet\nsatisfying, lots of medals to unlock\nand classic 'just one more go'\nreplayability, Aura-Aura Climber will\nbring you to new heights of fun!",
