    "description": "Try your luck playing on three slot machines: Hawaiian, Pirate Treasure and Mexican Heat. The one-armed bandits in “Adventure in Vegas: Slot Machine” are not only uniquely themed with tunes and graphics, but also have different special table features: the number of reels, extra buttons, winning sequences and custom bets. End your around-the-world trip in Vegas and bet the remainder of the small fortune you inherited. You have to be good to be lucky! Will you acquire more luxury goods like jewelry, a bike or your own jet?! Or maybe you’ll lose everything you win? Whatever the outcome, all you can do in Las Vegas is go for it!",
