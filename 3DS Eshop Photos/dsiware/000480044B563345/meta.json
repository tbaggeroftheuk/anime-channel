    "description": "It's a real action RPG with preeminent exhilaration set inside an infinitely-extending dungeon.\nSweep away the monsters wriggling in many places and get at defeating a strong boss monster lurking at the deepest portion of the dungeon.\n<br><br>\nEven after the boss monster is defeated, the dungeon re-creates itself with automatic system so the player can try new games over and over.\n<br><br>\nUsing the skill called \"Soul Capture,\" the character can take away the magic and other skills from the monsters, as well as weapons and shields to power up.\n<br><br>\nIt is very exhilarating to strengthen the character combining the equipments and skills, then crushing the monsters in a sweep.",
