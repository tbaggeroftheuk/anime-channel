Created by multimedia musician\nToshio Iwai, Electroplankton are living\naquatic 'instruments' that you interact\nwith to produce a variety of sounds\nand images limited only by your\nimagination!<br>\n<br>\nTrapy are graceful swimmers and love\nto emit sounds as they follow lines\ntraced along the water. Each of the\nsix types of Trapy produce different\ntones depending on the direction they\nswim; they produce low pitch sounds\nwhen they swim to the right and high\npitch sounds when they swim to the\nleft.<br>\n<br>\nUse Performance mode to create\nyour own unique compositions, or\nrelax with Audience mode and let the\nElectroplankton run wild.<br>\n<br>\nPlease note that elements of this\nsoftware may have been featured in\npreviously-released software.",
