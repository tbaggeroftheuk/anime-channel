    "description": "Rytmik World Music is an application\nfor creating rhythmical and melodic\nthemes, and for composing entire\nsongs. Its user interface blends the\nfast and well-arranged interface of\nclassic drum machines with a flexible\npattern interface of popular trackers\nand a modern sound library. It\ncontains 117 carefully-picked,\nauthentic sounds of ethnic drums and\npercussion, as well as plucked,\nmallet, bowed and wind instruments,\nwhich are complemented by a\nselection of synth drums, basses and\npads, together creating a strong and\ncreative mix of sounds and rhythms for\nyour compositions – not just from the\nsphere of world music. Compositions\nbeing played are visualised on the\nupper screen in the classical\ndemoscene style with 20 types of\nvisualisation to choose from.\nMoreover, the application contains a\nrhythm library and a varied collection\nof pre-made compositions that you\nmay use to quickly compose your own\npieces. For the best musical\nexperience, we recommend connecting\nheadphones or a quality speaker\nsystem.\n<br/><br/>\nWith Rytmik World Music you can\nquickly and easily create the basic\nbuilding stone: an audio clip, which\nconsists of musical notations for up to\nfour instruments that you may\ntranspose. Select their location in the\nstereo field, and modify their volume,\nreverse, shuffle (rhythm twist) and\npolyphony (with extended polyphony\nhandling), plus chorus/widening stereo\neffect, echo and arpeggiator. You\nmay, arbitrarily, combine up to 128\nsuch clips in four tracks and create\ncomplex pieces of music. Moreover,\nyou have a collection of 11 pre-made\ncompositions at your disposal, from\nwhich you may quickly compose your\nown pieces.\n<br/><br/>\nRytmik World Music is not only for\nplaying with sounds; in the hands of a\nskilful musician it can become a\nserious musical instrument – a\nsurprisingly powerful pocket music\nstation. For the best musical\nexperience, we recommend connecting\nheadphones or a quality speaker\nsystem. You’ll become the king of the\nparty in no time...",
