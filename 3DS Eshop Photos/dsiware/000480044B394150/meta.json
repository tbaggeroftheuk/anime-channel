    "description": "A steel ball and 22 football players\non springs in shallow dips; a pitch\nsurrounded by barriers and with a goal\nat each end. It's a concept that's\nbeen around for a hundred years and\nwhich still sees matches decided on\nquick combinations and accurate\nshots on goal. When possession is\nlost, it becomes your opponent's turn.\nThe game is controlled using the\nstylus, which allows players to\naccurately aim and determine the\npower of a pass or shot. Players are\nselected by their heads, pulled back\nand released. The game's physics\nengine ensures smooth, realistic travel\nof the ball around the pitch, either\ndelivering it into the goal or to\nanother player.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, it's also possible to inject\nthe mechanics of this turn-based game\nwith a shot of adrenaline. Just imagine\nreplacing the ball with a time bomb.\nPasses have to be faster and even\nmore accurate. Plus, intentionally\nlosing possession of the ball at a key\nmoment becomes a strategic option in\na match. A player unlucky enough to\nbe on the receiving end of the time\nbomb's blast has to leave the field\nand you can only hope your\ngoalkeeper doesn't meet a similar\nfate.<br>\n<br>\nGoooooal Europa 2012 features\nseveral game modes. In addition to\nstandard matches or matches with\ntime bombs, you can choose a\nsingle-player match, a two-player\nmatch, a 16-team tournament, and\neven a demanding campaign packed\nfull of challenging tasks in which you\ncan win various achievements.<br>\n<br>\nThe game can be customised with\nmany various settings, including\noverall difficulty, a goal limit and the\nre-spawning of players blasted by time\nbombs. Plus, you can, of course, also\nchoose your team's strip and the\ngame will automatically select\nbetween dark and light variants.<br>\n<br>\nIn brief:<br>\n<br>\n• A table-top football game.<br>\n<br>\n• Play against the computer or a\nfriend.<br>\n<br>\n• An authentic simulation of a real\ntable-top football game, with players\non springs, playing with a steel\nfootball.<br>\n<br>\n• A turn-based game in which a\nplayer's go ends with loss of\npossession.<br>\n<br>\n• Features an innovative ARCADE\nmode: replace the football with a\ntime bomb and send the opponent’s\nplayers to the bench!<br>\n<br>\n• Physics-based simulation of ball\ntravel over an uneven pitch.<br>\n<br>\n• Play single matches, tournaments\nor skill campaigns featuring 20\nobjectives.<br>\n<br>\n• Win exciting achievements.<br>\n<br>\n• Choose from 16 national teams\ncompeting in this year’s championship.<br>\n<br>\n• Special edition Goooooal Europa\n2012 features the following teams:\nCroatia, Czech Republic, Denmark,\nEngland, France, Germany, Greece,\nItaly, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,\nRepublic of Ireland, Russia, Spain,\nSweden and the Ukraine.",
