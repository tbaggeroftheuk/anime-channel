    "description": "Chimaki from Guilty Gear 2 stars in a quirky platformer appropriately named Pro Jumper Chimaki's Hot Spring Tour Guilty Gear Tangent!? Make use of Chimakiâ€™s run, jump and towel attack to collect apples and successfully bypass the legions hellbent on his destruction and reach the hot spring located at the very end of each stage. Chimaki is a lover, not a fighter, and as\nsuch a mere two hits will cause him to expire.\n\nChimaki is a tiny creature with an insatiable lust for life. Something of a recluse, he ventures out of his hermitage on occasion to seek the truth. What goes on behind that implacable face is a mystery--perhaps, even to Chimaki himself.",
