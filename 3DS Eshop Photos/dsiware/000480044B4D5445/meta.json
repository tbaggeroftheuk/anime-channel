    "description": "The Nintendo DSi Metronome software can be used to help keep tempo—when playing an instrument, for example. It creates a rhythm by playing sounds based on beat and tempo settings, which both allow a wide range of possible adjustments. In addition, choose from three metronome designs (including one based on Nintendo’s Game & Watch: Ball title!) and record your own beat sounds for the metronome to use. Or, if you want to take a break, enjoy a unique minigame: Donkey Kong Metronome, in which you make sounds into the microphone to match the beat and have Mario jump over Donkey Kong’s barrels. ",
