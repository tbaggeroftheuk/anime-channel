Use your arsenal of weapons to take out adversaries and proceed through the enemy base, utilizing cover of crates to avoid fire. Collect ammo and first aid kits you find along the way to keep your life gauge from reaching zero and to clear each stage before the time runs out or it's game over. When you do make it to the end of each stage a barrage of enemies will try to bring you down so don't let up your attack against the Shadow Army!",
