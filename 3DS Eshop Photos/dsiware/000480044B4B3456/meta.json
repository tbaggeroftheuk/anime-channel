    "description": "From the makers of brain-teasing\nclassics like Actionloop and Polarium\ncomes a new challenge, one that will\ntest both your grey matter and your\nstylus skills!<br>\n<br>\nWakugumi: Monochrome Puzzle is\nbased on a simple premise: clear\nblack and white blocks from the play\narea, ‘capturing’ blocks of one colour\nby surrounding them with blocks of\nthe opposite colour. You control the\naction with your stylus, swapping\nblocks back and forth to make the\nperfect captures.<br>\n<br>\nLearn the basics in Training Mode,\nthen test your capturing techniques in\nScore Attack as you try to clear as\nmany blocks as possible within a time\nlimit, chaining captures together to\nscore bonuses. Or try your hand at\nTime Attack – can you erase all the\nblocks and work your way down the\nvertical course as quickly as possible?",
