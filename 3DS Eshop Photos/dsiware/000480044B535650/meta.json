    "description": "The work of a warehouse keeper\nnever required such a high IQ! Will\nyou earn the Cool Job?\n<br/><br/>\nSokomania 2 enhances the popular\ngameplay principles with many new\ndynamic features. The traditional maze\nfull of crates that have to be pushed\nto the right spots is just an opening\nwarm-up in Sokomania 2. Everything\nchanges the instant the momentum\ncomes into play; crates start to move\non their own, corridors of the\nwarehouse become divided with\ndoors, and switches or turntables that\ncan change the direction in which\ncrates move appear on the floor. At\nmoments like these, one has to start\nthinking hard or patiently experiment\nwith various possibilities.\n<br/><br/>\nLevels are arranged by their\ndifficulty, allowing players to\ngradually adopt new gameplay\nfeatures and their combinations. The\nwarehouse keeper can be controlled\nwith the +Control Pad and there is an\ninteractive map of the whole\nwarehouse on the bottom screen that\ncan be used to promptly inspect any\ncorner of the level. The objective of\nthe warehouse keeper is to place all\ncrates on the target squares while\ntaking as few steps as possible. Those\nwho want to find an optimal solution\nwill certainly appreciate the time loop\nfeature. It enables you to ‘rewind’ the\nrecording of the warehouse events at\nany time so that you can try another\napproach.\n<br/><br/>\nSokomania 2 allows up to three\nseparate game profiles to be created\nand it generates a unique game code\nfor each player, which can be\nsubmitted to a website and entered\ninto the global leaderboard. The total\nscore can be improved by returning to\nan already completed level and\nfinding a better solution.\n<br/><br/>\nAnalyse, focus, think, and find the\nbest solution in the right time.\nCompare your skills with others!\n<br/><br/>\nIn short:\n<br/><br/>\n• 100 levels of different sizes and\ndifficulties\n<br/><br/>\n• new dynamic gameplay features:\ndoors, pressure and movement floor\nswitches and turntables\n<br/><br/>\n• 2 types of target squares: transit\nand freezing\n<br/><br/>\n• regular crates and crates with\nmomentum on one or two axes\n<br/><br/>\n• interactive map allowing users to\ninspect the whole level\n<br/><br/>\n• time looping to turn back time\n<br/><br/>\n• 3 profiles and a unique game code\nfor the global leaderboard",
