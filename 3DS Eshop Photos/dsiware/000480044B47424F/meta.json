    "description": "Experience a piece of Nintendo history with the Game & Watch series for Nintendo DSiWare. Each title is a perfect recreation of a classic LCD game from the early 1980s, including normal Game A and alternate Game B modes.<br>\n<br>\nAnd no Game & Watch title would be complete without the \"Watch\" function - each title includes a fully functional clock.<br>\n<br>\nBall was the first original Game & Watch ever to be produced. As a juggler (who we now know as Mr Game & Watch), you must keep the fragile balls up in the air for as long as possible, scoring points for each catch. Don't drop even one ball or it’s Game Over! Game A features two balls to juggle, Game B has three balls, each worth 10 points per catch.",
