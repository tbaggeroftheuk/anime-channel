It\ncontains more than 170 carefully\nselected sound samples of drums,\ncymbals, percussion, bass and\nmelodic instruments.<br>\n<br>\nWith Rytmik you can quickly and\neasily create the basic building stone\n– an audio clip. It consists of musical\nnotations for up to four instruments\nthat you may transpose, select their\nlocation in the stereo field, and\nmodify their volume, polyphony and\necho. You may arbitrarily combine up\nto 128 such clips in four tracks and\ncreate complex pieces of music.\nMoreover you have a rhythm library\nand varied collection of 16 pre-made\ncompositions at your disposal that\nyou may quickly compose your own\npieces from.<br>\n<br>\nRytmik is not only for playing with\nsounds; in the hands of a skilful\nmusician it can become a serious\nmusical instrument – surprisingly\npowerful pocket music station.
