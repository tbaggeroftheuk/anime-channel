    "description": "Aura-Aura has fallen out of the sky and landed on Earth! He is determined to return to his rightful place in the universe and become a bright star. Take control of Aura-Aura, and help him to accomplish this by using his grapple arm to grab a variety of grapple points and continuously climb higher in the sky. Along the way, collect items to aid him (bombs, extensions for his grapple arm) and avoid enemies that damage Aura-Aura’s health. Two modes of play offer very different challenges: Score Attack, in which you try to get to the goal with as many points as possible, and Endless, in which your aim is simply to help Aura-Aura climb as high into the sky as possible within the time limit. And even if you think you’ve mastered the art of climbing, both modes offer numerous medals to find or earn by completing specific tasks. With its intuitive controls, straight forward game play, and incredible replay value, Aura-Aura’s journey is arcade-style gaming at its best...or should that be its highest?\n\n\n",
