    "description": "Rytmik Rock Edition is an application\nfor creating rhythmical and melodic\nthemes and for composing whole\nsongs. Its user interface blends the\nfast and well-arranged interface of\nclassic drum machines with the flexible\npattern interface of popular trackers\nand a modern sound library. It\ncontains more than 130 carefully\nselected sound samples of drum set,\nkeyboards, bass, clean, lead and\nrhythm guitars instruments.<br>\n<br>\nWith Rytmik Rock Edition you can\nquickly and easily create the basic\nbuilding block – an audio clip. It\nconsists of musical notations for up to\nfour instruments that you may\ntranspose, select their location in the\nstereo field, and modify their volume,\npolyphony (with extended polyphony\nhandling), chorus/widening stereo\neffect and echo. You may arbitrarily\ncombine up to 128 such clips in four\ntracks and create complex pieces of\nmusic. Moreover, you have a\ncollection of 10 pre-made\ncompositions at your disposal from\nwhich you may quickly compose your\nown pieces.<br>\n<br>\nRytmik Rock Edition is not only for\nplaying with sounds; in the hands of a\nskilful musician it can become a\nserious musical instrument –\nsurprisingly powerful pocket music\nstation. For the best musical\nexperience we recommend connecting\nheadphones or a quality speaker\nsystem. You’ll become the king of the\nRock party in no time...",
