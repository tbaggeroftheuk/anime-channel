    "description": "Welcome to the cab of the \"OIGAWA RAILWAY\"!\n<br>\n<br>You will be operating the SL used at the OIGAWA RAILWAY!\n<br>This SL will depart from \"Shinkanaya Station\", and head to the last stop, \"Senzu Station\".\n<br>\n<br>The journey of 37.2 km starts, running aside of Oi-gawa river running through Shizuoka.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The SL uses steam to run, so control of steam is essential.\n<br>\n<br>Control the \"throttle valve\" to accelerate, and use the notchless brake to stop at the stopping position!\n<br>\n<br>There are many curves and uphills because the route wounds through the mountain.\n<br>From the front observatory, you can see the vast green of tea plantations, and enjoy a refreshing scenery.\n<br>\n<br>Listen to the exciting SL sounds and proceed through the serene scenery!",
