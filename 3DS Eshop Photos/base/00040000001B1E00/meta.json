    "description": "With more than 10,000 words hidden in a grid of 90,000 letters, Word Search 10K is the largest, most epic, word search ever made!\n<br>\n<br>The puzzle is arranged as 100 themed sections, each containing roughly 100 words - but even each section is much too large to fit on screen! Scroll with the +Control Pad or Circle Pad, then touch with the Nintendo 3DS™ stylus to highlight words.\n<br>\n<br>To solve the entire thing, you'll have to find words from categories as diverse as boys' names, hair styles and accountancy.\n<br>\n<br>You'll visit London, Las Vegas and outer space.\n<br>You'll encounter spiders, vampires and fictional horses.\n<br>You'll be transported from ancient Egypt, through the world of dreams and to the end of days.\n<br>\n<br>Share your progress with other players using StreetPass™.",
