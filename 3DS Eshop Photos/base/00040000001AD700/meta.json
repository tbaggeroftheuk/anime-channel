    "description": "The stars of Chicken Wiggle are an improbable duo: a young chicken and his best buddy – a wiggly worm – nestled in his backpack! Together, they team up for adventure to jump, peck, and worm-grapple across a myriad of perplexing platforming levels – full of fun gadgets, tricky hazards, and sneaky foes – determined to rescue their friends from the wicked witch in her sky towers.\n<br>\n<br>But wait, there’s more! Aspiring game designers and playful doodlers alike can spend hours of fun hatching their own levels with the user-friendly level creator included with the game.

Once you’re ready, it’s easy to share your creations on-line with other Chicken Wiggle players via the community portal. Now, anyone can be a game designer on the go!\n<br>\n<br>Players seeking more levels to play after completing Chicken Wiggle’s main story mode will find a wealth of unique levels to download, play, and rate for free!
