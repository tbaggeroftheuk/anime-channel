    "description": "As of late March 2023, it will no longer be possible to make purchases in Nintendo eShop for Nintendo 3DS, including add-on content for this game. For more information please visit Support.\n<br><br>\nFeel the crack of the bat in a collection of baseball-themed minigames! Then, take a breather and haggle with hilarious ol’ Rusty to lower the real-life Nintendo eShop price of additional batting, pitching, and fielding minigames, plus a whole lot more!\n<br><br>\nKnock it out of the park in a series of baseball-themed minigames that will have you swinging at disappearing fastballs, bringing down UFOs with the help of some rubber tires, or even becoming an umpire and ringing up batters. But before you play ball, you’ll have to haggle with that miserable mutt, ex-pro baseball player Rusty Slugger, to lower the actual Nintendo eShop purchase price of each minigame! Don’t worry, you can use weird in-game items like donuts and nose hair trimmers (that’s not a typo) to help you get the lowest price possible.",
