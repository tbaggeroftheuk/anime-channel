    "description": "Have you got what it takes to beat\n<br>The Cube?\n<br><br/><br/>\n<br>If you’re a fan of the TV show, you\n<br>know that the aim of the game is to\n<br>win seven consecutive challenges\n<br>chosen by The Cube in order to walk\n<br>away with the maximum prize of\n<br>£250,000. Money ratings shown are\n<br>illustrative only. No cash prizes are\n<br>offered for playing this game.\n<br><br/><br/>\n<br>It’s the same on your\n<br>Nintendo 3DS™, although there are a\n<br>couple of extra challenges and new\n<br>ways to play. You can even challenge\n<br>friends and family to see if anyone has\n<br>what it takes. And because you‘re\n<br>playing for fun not real cash, you can\n<br>play as many times as you like.",
