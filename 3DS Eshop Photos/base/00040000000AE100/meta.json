    "description": "In the game you’ll be taking on the\nrole of an assistant who works for\nProfessor Burnet - a scientist studying\nthe Interdream Zone. Move your\nNintendo 3DS system around in this\nmotion-controlled action game and\ntake aim to shoot your light beam at\nthe Dream Clouds and collect your\nrewards! This game is fun for\nanybody, and a fact-filled\naccompaniment to Pokémon Black\nVersion 2 and Pokémon White Version\n2. Any caught Pokémon or items you\npick up in Pokémon Dream Radar can\nbe transferred to Pokémon Black\nVersion 2 and Pokémon White Version\n2, which is very useful, since the\nPokémon you catch might have hidden\nabilities not available for those games,\nand some items that can’t normally be\nfound either. Try to fill up your\nPokédex as much as you can!",
