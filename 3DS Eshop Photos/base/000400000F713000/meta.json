    "description": "Sketchy Snowboarding is a hand drawn infinite snowboarder where no two runs are the same. Carve, ollie, grab, grind, and spray folklore beasts to progress through 100 unique challenges. \n<br>\n<br>The rules are simple:\n<br>Carve to the left of red gates.\n<br>Carve to the right of blue gates.\n<br>Don't run into stuff.\n<br>Send it deep.\n<br>\n<br>The \"art\", sound, and code was created in Colorado and outdoors whenever possible. This project kept me sane during a skateboarding injury in 2018 and I hope you have as much fun playing it as I did making it.",
