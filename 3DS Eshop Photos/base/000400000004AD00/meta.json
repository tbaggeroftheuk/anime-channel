Play as Max, the hero and bug slayer, who must defend Maisy, a girl whose gardens bring life back to the wasteland. Squash giant mutated centipedes, spiders, beetles, grubs, caterpillars, moths, and more. Explore an expansive all-new world with gardens, wastelands, marshlands and 3 other environments. Lay waste to these mutated bugs with weapons such as the Lightning Gun, Nuke Cannon, Flamethrower, and more. Use the bodies of dead bugs to craft new defenses and power-ups like turret guns and barricades, or just crush them with your mighty stomp!",
