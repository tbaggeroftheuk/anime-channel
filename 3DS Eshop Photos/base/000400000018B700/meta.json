    "description": "Unleash the energi skills and engage\n<br>in turn-based battles in an epic JRPG\n<br>that harks back to the best in classic\n<br>gaming!\n<br>\n<br>It has been almost a century since\n<br>the end of the Energi War. Yet despite\n<br>the armistice agreement signed\n<br>between opposing sides, the\n<br>Schwarzschild Empire has once again\n<br>begun plotting world domination as it\n<br>starts to conquer and occupy one\n<br>nation after another. It is during this\n<br>time that Ash and Karim, two\n<br>residents of a small town on the\n<br>frontier, rescue a young woman and\n<br>her escort as they are being pursued\n<br>by foreign soldiers. But who is this\n<br>mysterious girl and what fate is in\n<br>store for Ash and those with him as\n<br>they attempt to help her fulfill her\n<br>mission...?\n<br>\n<br>Employing an orthodox turn-based\n<br>battle system, Alphadia evokes a\n<br>feeling of nostalgia with its classic\n<br>RPG style. In addition, its refined\n<br>game balance and simple to use\n<br>interface make this game accessible to\n<br>players of any skill level while at the\n<br>same time offering 30+ hours of\n<br>gameplay. Come experience Alphadia\n<br>and witness its dramatic story unfold!",
