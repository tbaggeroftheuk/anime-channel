    "description": "All Grace and Savannah want is to make it in Tokyo, but what’s with all the scenesters, bomb balls, flower displays, and ninjas getting in their way?!\n<br><br>\nYou’ll need lightning-fast reflexes and an eye for strategy to succeed in this fast-paced puzzle game, where live-action video blends seamlessly with wacky digital graphics.\n<br><br>\nThrow and roll hapless bystanders into lines of people, trying to group three or more who wear the same color together so that they’ll form a clique and disappear. Form cliques and eliminate the lines you’re facing as fast as you can to progress through the game’s many stages.\n<br><br>\nWith two different play modes—Story Mode and Challenge Mode—this game’s got you covered whether you’re looking for quick gaming sessions or longer endurance challenges.",
