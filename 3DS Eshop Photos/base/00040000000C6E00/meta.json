    "description": "Mia is direct, gruff and has a big mouth. She's a good shooter, but\nshe's also klutzy and can be pretty sensitive at times. And she always has a solution. Just not right now.\n<br><br>\nThe Secret Service just fired her. She has no money, no papers and no idea how she got into this situation.\n<br><br>\nBut she'll be damned if she doesn't find out what this crap is all about - to put it in her words.\n<br><br>\nStranded in Miami, she now goes to see her mother, whom she hasn't seen in years. And her mother has no inkling of Mia's real jobâ€¦\n<br><br>\nYou will meet a wide variety of people over the course of this gripping tale. Some will be on your side, others not so much. Proceed with caution and be sure to look and listen closely. It's the only way Mia can survive and maybe even find out who or what is behind it all.",
