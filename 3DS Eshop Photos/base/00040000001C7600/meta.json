    "description": "Rather than make a direct sequel to their bite-sized 2D action game Mighty Gunvolt from 2014, Inti Creates has made the next installment in the Mighty Gunvolt series a brand new full-sized game that features characters from multiple universes with Gunvolt (Azure Striker Gunvolt) and Beck (Mighty No. 9) taking the stage once again, but in a much deeper and more expansive world that differs greatly from the original in many ways.\n<br>\n<br>The game systems have been completely revamped and powered up with lots of new additions, including a deep character customization system that lets you mold and shape your character into the ultimate hero that works best for you! \n<br>\n<br>But that's not all! The new Burst Combo system rewards you for finishing off enemies and bosses up close and personal.\n<br>\n<br>The classic pixel style graphics have also been completely redone to blur the line between 8-bit and 16-bit and take you back to the golden age of 2D action games!",
