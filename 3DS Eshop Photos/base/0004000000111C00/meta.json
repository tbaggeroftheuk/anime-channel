    "description": "Yoshi’s New Island is the first\n<br>instalment in this series since Yoshi’s\n<br>Island DS was released in 2006.\n<br><br/><br/>\n<br>Yoshi’s good old Flutter Jump,\n<br>Ground Pound and egg-throwing\n<br>return, along with new abilities and\n<br>challenges that take advantage of the\n<br>features of the Nintendo 3DS. You\n<br>can use massive eggs called\n<br>Mega-Eggs to destroy blocks and\n<br>pipes, revealing secrets such as coins\n<br>and hidden keys. The more things you\n<br>destroy, the higher the Mega-Egg\n<br>gauge goes, netting you extra lives in\n<br>the process!\n<br><br/><br/>\n<br>The beautiful art is based on many\n<br>classic styles, such as oil painting,\n<br>watercolours and crayon drawings.",
