    "description": "Wanted: Tri Force Heroes! Still not sure if you’re cut out to be a true hero? Then participate in this hero “try out” by downloading this special demo! During select times on 10/30 to 11/1, you can go online to meet up with other heroes in training. You will be able to try out 3 pre-selected dungeons with 3 pre-selected outfits.\n<br><br>\nIf you miss your chance to go online, you can still play over local wireless with 2 other friends who also have a Nintendo 3DS family system with this demo version of the game. But with local wireless, only one dungeon is available. Single player mode and Download Play are not available, and you will not be able to connect with players who have the full version of the game.",
