    "description": "Sonic is here to save the day, and\n<br>this time he’s got help from his friend\n<br>Tails! Dr. Eggman (AKA Dr. Robotnik)\n<br>is back and is planning on building his\n<br>ultimate weapon, the Death Egg. To\n<br>do so, he’s going to turn the animal\n<br>inhabitants of Mobius into his own\n<br>personal army of Badniks. Can Sonic\n<br>obtain the 7 Chaos Emeralds and stop\n<br>him once and for all?\n<br/><br/>\n<br>3D Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is\n<br>remastered in 3D and full of new\n<br>features! Is the Chemical Plant Zone\n<br>your favorite stage? Use “Stage\n<br>Select” and start running wherever\n<br>you want! Run fast without worrying\n<br>about your rings. Cut your losses by\n<br>choosing Ring Keeper Mode—only half\n<br>your rings will be lost after taking\n<br>damage!\n<br/><br/>\n<br>Keeping your rings and stopping Dr.\n<br>Eggman’s evil scheme is important,\n<br>but don’t forget to take some time off\n<br>from saving the world to play against\n<br>your friends in the 2 Player VS and\n<br>CO-OP Mode using Local Play!",
