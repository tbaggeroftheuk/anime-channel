    "description": "3D MahJongg gives you a huge variety of levels, gameplay variations and graphics themes. \n<br><br>\nIn 3D MahJongg, the goal is to find pairs of matching tiles in order to remove all tiles from the board. This sounds like a simple task, but you will soon find that a savvy strategy - along with a bit of luck -  is the key to success.\n<br><br>\nGameplay is direct and intuitive via the touch screen. You can closely observe everything on the 3D screen and make extensive changes to the way you view the tile layout. And you'll love the fabulous six graphics themes from \"Farm\" to \"Zombies\".\n<br><br>\nIn Adventure Mode, you will need to master 200 levels in order to unlock all tiles, backgrounds etc. You can then use these elements in free gameplay to create custom levels. You can also switch between classic rules and \"Rivers\" rules at any time.\n<br><br>\n2 game versions: Classic and Rivers mode<br>\nAdventure Mode with 200 levels<br>\nFree gameplay with more than\n10,000 variations<br>\n6 themes: Asia, Farm, Princess, Sea, Casino and Zombies",
