    "description": "Cave Story 3D is a side scrolling action adventure game inspired by the fan-favorite 2D original. Now in a full 3D world, Cave Story takes the proven 2D action and exploration into stereoscopic awesomeness.\n<br><br>\nYou wake up in a cave with no idea who you are or where you came from, but you know you must help a cute race of rabbit-like creatures beat the crap out of some crusty old doctor. As you advance through the game, youâ€™ll learn the origin of the Mimiga world and even your own. Like the critically acclaimed Pixel masterpiece, Cave Story 3D is a combination of high-speed shooting action scenes with heavy emphasis on platforming, exploration, and light puzzle solving, as well as a deep storyline. Also you can experience the original indie hit with exclusive \"paper\" 2D pixel mode!",
