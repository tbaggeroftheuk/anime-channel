    "description": "3D THUNDER BLADE is a recreation\n<br>of a one-of-a-kind combat originally\n<br>released in 1987, re-mastered for the\n<br>Nintendo 3DS™ hand-held system. In\n<br>3D Thunder Blade, players control a\n<br>helicopter and use guns and missiles\n<br>to destroy enemy vehicles while flying\n<br>between buildings, through caves, and\n<br>into enemy bases. The re-mastered\n<br>version boasts stereoscopic 3D visuals\n<br>and adds a host of new features.\n<br>Some of the additional features\n<br>include: gyro controls, adjustable\n<br>difficulty settings, Circle Pad Pro\n<br>support, and a load of options that\n<br>recreate the look and feel of the\n<br>original arcade machine. Replay\n<br>saving and stage select are also\n<br>available! 3D Thunder Blade also\n<br>introduces brand new remixes of the\n<br>original in-game music that can be\n<br>toggled ‘on’ and ‘off’ and an\n<br>unlockable Special Mode with updated\n<br>gameplay, new enemies, and a more\n<br>powerful fighter.",
