    "description": "Radio waves are all around you.<br>\nHowever, what you might not know is that, at any and all times, mysterious little creatures float around near these waves.<br>\nThey're called \"Denpa\" Men. You can't see them normally, but you can find them and catch them with your Nintendo 3DS.\n<br><br>\nThis is a role-playing game in which you collect Denpa Men to form a party, and use this party to explore dungeons.\n<br><br>\nEach radio wave territory has its own completely unique Denpa Men, and no two of them are ever the same!<br>\nTheir faces, bodies, and personalities are all different, and some of them even have special skills and strong points.<br>\nThere's a practically infinite number of variations!<br>\nSometimes, you'll even find Denpa Men who are exceptionally strong.<br><br>\n\nTry searching in lots of different places to form your own team of these wonderful tiny critters, and take them on an adventure to rescue a certain special someone from the clutches of the King of Evil!",
