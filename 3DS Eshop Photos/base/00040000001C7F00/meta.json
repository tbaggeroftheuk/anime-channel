    "description": "Cube Creator DX is a creative, action-adventure game with a freedom to explore the world of cubes with the look and feel coming from Japanese gameplay origins. Fight against monsters, gather resources, and craft new materials in this enhanced Cube Creator adaptation. You can build stages and share them with friends, or download stages created by other players in the Swapatorium - the place to view and try out stages. A swath of brand new monsters and enemies come out at night, and you’ll have to evade or fight them, or even place them into your own original worlds. There are also lots of new animals that can be collected, and can even be made to be your pet; they can be ridden around the environments. Use the new map feature to show where you and each of your friends are located in the environment. In survival mode and creative mode, you can play online or local with friends up to four players.
