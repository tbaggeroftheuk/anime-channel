    "description": "Baron Von Sottendorff is an\n<br>aristocrat in the early 20th century.\n<br>He doesn't know it, but he is really\n<br>living trapped in a grid drawing of his\n<br>mansion, created by his own lunatic\n<br>mind.\n<br><br/><br/>\n<br>The game has a new focus that\n<br>combines the essence of gaming\n<br>platforms with puzzles in a beautiful\n<br>scenery created from artistic elements\n<br>and references.\n<br><br/><br/>\n<br>The objective of the game is to free\n<br>Baron Von Sottendorff from his own\n<br>madness; to do this, you must\n<br>overcome the challenges that appear\n<br>along the way. As you solve the\n<br>different levels, you receive objects\n<br>that will help you unlock memories\n<br>from his life. The more memories you\n<br>get, the closer you are to regaining\n<br>his sanity.\n<br><br/><br/>\n<br>Go crazy and help the Baron get his\n<br>sanity back! But be careful...the\n<br>rooms of the mansion move about and\n<br>it's easy to get lost in his world.",
