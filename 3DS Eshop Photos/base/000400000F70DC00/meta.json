    "description": "'Zeus Quests Remastered' is a silly point and click adventure game with light-hearted humour. It combines Greek Mythology with Sci-Fi in a twisted way!\n<br>\n<br>You control Zeus (Boss of Olympus) which is a wacky character. He tries to fix a time machine to save the planet from explosion. Everything happens in Greek mythology timeframe. The characters and dialogues are silly and translated into 6 languages. There is English Voice over in some cut scenes. We use Vector art, a unique cartoonish style.",
