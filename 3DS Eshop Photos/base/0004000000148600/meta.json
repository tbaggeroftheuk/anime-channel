    "description": "I've Got to Run: Complete Edition! is a 2D autorunning platformer where you guide Roy the Marshmallow Boy and his friends through a series of levels that become more difficult the longer you last. The game features six distinct modes:\n<br><br>\nEndless Classic: The standard level with no added features.\n<br><br>\nEndless Double: In this level, you have a double jump, represented on screen by a yellow wing.\n<br><br>\nEndless Special: This level, set in outer space, starts slower, but can become blindingly fast if you pick up enough of the speed-up items!\n<br><br>\nEndless Expert: The hardest mode, only for true experts, goes very fast and only gets harder from there!\n<br><br>\nEndless Flip: Roy and his friends are back to the kitchen from Endless Classic..but something's a bit off.\n<br><br>\nEndless Flight: Roy and friends have way more jumps than usual, but the sky isn't without its fair share of traps and obstacles!",
