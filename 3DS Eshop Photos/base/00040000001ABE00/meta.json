    "description": "What is Kutar?\n<br>\n<br>Kutar is the character who has incredible expressionless emotions that can't be distinguished by laughing or crying.\n<br>\n<br>Kutar is not a dog, cat or bear.\n<br>\n<br>Kutar is always Kutar no matter where he is going or doing.\n<br>\n<br>Though being so expressionless, when Kutar wants to laugh, cry, love or be angry, all feelings are still very ordinary.\n<br>\n<br>No matter what happens, the emotions will not change. Even when a desperate situation arrives, Kutar will just inflate his body and overcome. What a wonderful Yuru-chara.\n<br>\n<br>The lovely and funny Kutar game series is everywhere! Just finish the quest's challenges with simple controls.\n<br>\n<br>This time Kutar is making burgers, you only need to place the bread. But any mistakes will not be tolerable!",
