    "description": "Shift DX marks the return of the classic Shift series. The game will feature all of the levels contained in Shift 1 and 2, along with 100 all-new levels designed specially for this release.\n<br>\n<br>Many have tried to emulate the gameplay of Shift since its first release in 2008, but none have managed to capture the frantic, mind-bending nature of the series. Players are tasked with making their way through a series of perplexing rooms, equipped with nothing more than their ability to “shift” the playing field. Is a wall blocking you from progressing? Flip that level upside down and turn that wall into a pit! \n<br>\n<br>Of course, that’s only the beginning of the challenges players will encounter in Shift DX. The road to victory is paved with mysterious items, complex environmental puzzles, and a variety of deadly traps. \n<br>\n<br>Features:\n<br>\n<br>Over 100 brand-new puzzles\n<br>Shift 1 and Shift 2 levels included\n<br>New Shift Challenge gameplay mode\n<br>Create levels with the Level Editor\n<br>Share levels online as QR Codes\n<br>\"Pop-Art\" and \"Classic\" visual modes\n<br>Unlockable playable characters from several indie games",
