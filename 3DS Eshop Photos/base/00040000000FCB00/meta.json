    "description": "Join the Battle! Destroy the Enemies!\nWin the War!\n<br/><br/>\n3D tank battle action returns! Like\nbefore, maneuver your tank with the\nCircle Pad and aim & shoot with the\nstylus.\n<br/><br/>\nThis time, there are two types of\ntanks--the attack type with its\npowerful offensive capabilities, and the\ndefense type with its impregnable\ndefenses. The attack type improves\nupon the original charge shot with the\nultimate weapon--the super charge\nshot. It cuts a swath of devastation\nthrough any armor. The defense type\nfeatures a shield that bounces back\nany attack.\n<br/><br/>\nThe hostiles have added new\nweapons like wave shots, scatter\nshots, lasers, and drills. Hover units\nunaffected by the terrain and a\ncloaking stealth system have also\nbeen added. Gargantuan tanks have\nalso joined the enemy's forces. The\noriginal's weapon systems are back\ntoo, like ricochet, homing, and\nmortar-type shots.\n<br/><br/>\nThere are 90 stages in all (60\nregular and 30 bonus stages)--20\nmore than the previous game. Strap\nyourself in and gear up for an intense,\nfuturistic tank shooting war--the\noriginal was only the beginning.",
