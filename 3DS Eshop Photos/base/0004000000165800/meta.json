    "description": "SENRAN KAGURA 2: Deep Crimson\n<br>is the latest Nintendo 3DS™ title in\n<br>the infamous SENRAN KAGURA\n<br>franchise. For those who aren’t\n<br>familiar, expect a fast-paced beat ‘em\n<br>up game with insane combo chains,\n<br>plenty of playable characters,\n<br>hilarious cutscenes and an abundance\n<br>of tantalising action!\n<br>\n<br>The game picks up directly where its\n<br>Nintendo 3DS™ predecessor SENRAN\n<br>KAGURA Burst left off, and follows\n<br>the Hanzo & Hebijo Shinobi\n<br>Academies as they battle for good\n<br>and evil respectively. This time\n<br>however there is a greater evil at\n<br>work, as the tyrannous tycoon behind\n<br>the Hebijo Academy is hell-bent on\n<br>raining terror across all of Japan by\n<br>utilising a destructive army of\n<br>summoned demons! This great danger\n<br>thrusts the girls together and forces\n<br>them to unite and work as one in a\n<br>way the series has never seen before.\n<br>\n<br>FEATURES:\n<br>Pair Battles\n<br>For the first time ever, two shinobi\n<br>warriors from opposing academies\n<br>must fight together, and the dual\n<br>character combo system allows for\n<br>spectacular and devastating joint\n<br>attacks.\n<br>\n<br>Improved graphics and stellar audio\n<br>The graphical improvement from\n<br>‘Burst’ is dramatic, with full 3D\n<br>environments, improved animations\n<br>and a better framerate! This is\n<br>combined with original Japanese\n<br>voice-overs to create a gorgeous\n<br>experience all-round.\n<br>\n<br>Local & Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection\n<br>Co-op mode\n<br>For the first time on Nintendo 3DS™,\n<br>two players will be able to join forces\n<br>and play the story or special missions\n<br>together via ad hoc multiplayer or\n<br>online.\n<br>\n<br>Improved Dressing Room\n<br>The dressing room is stocked with\n<br>hundreds of items, and this time up to\n<br>two shinobi can be present in the\n<br>dressing room at once! Also, for the\n<br>very first time in the series you can\n<br>pose the girls in a variety of positions,\n<br>and even pose them in real life\n<br>environments using the Nintendo\n<br>3DS™’ built-in camera!",
