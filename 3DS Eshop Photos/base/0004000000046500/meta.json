    "description": "Introducing Cubic Ninja™, the Nintendo 3DS™ title that lets you play without ever touching a button. Simply tilt and turn your Nintendo 3DS to solve challenging puzzles, outwit devious enemies, and escape intricate traps.\n<br><br>\nCubic Ninja places you in the role of CC, a brave little ninja with a distinctly cubic shape. The princess of your beloved kingdom – plus a few of your ninja friends -- has been abducted. And it’s up to you to save them. To do so, you must tilt and turn your way through over 100 eye-opening levels, defeating adversaries such as Woofbot, Scorchbot, and more. From raging infernos to elemental forces of wind and water, your enemies will do whatever it takes to stop you.     \n<br><br>\nBut you won’t be stopped. If you have to tumble till you’re dizzy, or survive raging waters just to rescue the princess, then you will. Because you’re Cubic Ninja. And that’s how you roll.",
