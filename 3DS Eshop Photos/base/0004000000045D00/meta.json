    "description": "PAC-MAN & Galaga Dimensions is a\ncollection of six complete games,\nincluding four previous titles from the\nPAC-MAN and Galaga franchises, as\nwell as two brand new games\ndesigned to harness the power of\nNintendo 3DS.<br>\n<br>\nIn PAC-MAN tilt, you’ll utilise the\nNintendo 3DS system’s built-in gyro\nsensor to guide the spherical yellow\nhero through inventive levels crammed\nwith challenge. By tilting the Nintendo\n3DS system you’ll alter the angle of\nthe entire stage, causing PAC-MAN to\nroll at high speed and setting him up\nto use level elements like flippers and\nswings that can catapult him to new\nheights. It’s a whole new way to take\ncontrol of one of gaming’s most\nfamous heroes, and it’s all brought to\nlife in glorious 3D!",
