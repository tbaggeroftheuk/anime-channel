    "description": "What is Kutar?\n<br>\n<br>Kutar is the character who has \n<br>incredible expressionless emotions\n<br>that can't be distinguished by\n<br>laughing or crying.\n<br>\n<br>Kutar is not a dog, cat or bear.\n<br>\n<br>Kutar is always Kutar no matter\n<br>where he is going or what he is doing.\n<br>\n<br>Though being so expressionless,\n<br>when Kutar wants to laugh, cry, love\n<br>or be angry, all feelings are still very\n<br>ordinary.\n<br>\n<br>No matter what happens, the\n<br>emotions will not change. Even if a\n<br>desperate situation arrives, Kutar will\n<br>just inflate his body and overcome.\n<br>What a wonderful Yuru-chara.\n<br>\n<br>The lovely and funny Kutar game\n<br>series is everywhere! Just finish the\n<br>quest's challenges with simple\n<br>controls.\n<br>\n<br>This time Kutar works at the powder\n<br>factory. He must catch the powder\n<br>from the tubes above very carefully.",
