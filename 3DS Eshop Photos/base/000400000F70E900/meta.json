    "description": "It is a game series where two people can play against one device.\n<br>If you play with your body in close contact, the match will be more fun.\n<br>Any two partners, including parents, friends, lovers, etc, are suitable.\n<br>\n<br>Because it is simple and rules that everyone knows, you can start the game immediately on the spot. If you use the handicap function you can match the level of the two people.\n<br>\n<br>Because the match-up time is short, I can play anytime and anywhere when I feel like it.\n<br>Of course there is also a 1P play mode for one's time.\n<br>\n<br>Please enjoy together! \n<br>\n<br>SPEED is one of simple and profound card games that will win if you use up your hand first.\n<br>It is characterized by requiring reflexes.",
