    "description": "Long ago, the world was ensnared in Chaos – a dark force that threatened civilisations across the land. In order to shelter the people from harm, a prosperous oasis was built, but a powerful beast soon appeared in the skies above and rained down destruction, leaving nothing but ruin.\n<br>\n<br>Now, as a chosen Seedling and descendant of those ill-fated people, it’s down to you to pioneer a new oasis, secure a peaceful existence for those who inhabit the land, and banish the evil Chaos once and for all.\n<br>\n<br>Travel beyond the safety of your oasis and into a sprawling desert ruled by Chaos. Unearth and explore puzzle-filled dungeons, and forge new allegiances along the way!",
