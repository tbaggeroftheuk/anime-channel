    "description": "Get ready for a new horrific experience. \n<br>\n<br>In Phasmophobia, you will need to navigate throughout the haunted halls to collect all the hidden pages in order to escape. But beware, for each page you collect, the game will increase in speed, and the spirits will be angered. Gather the pages and find the exit!\n<br>\n<br>Phasmophobia was originally part of an indie game jam in which developers had to remake a classic arcade game. We added a horror twist to ours.\n<br>\n<br>And now there is a new unlockable game mode exclusive to Hall of Specters 3D, Insanity Mode! In this new mode, you have only one life and there is a time limit! If you dont beat the game within the time limit you lose!",
