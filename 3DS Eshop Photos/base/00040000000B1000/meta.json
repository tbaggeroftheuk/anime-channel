Choose\nfrom three character profiles, each\nwith unique attributes, and use a\ncombination of brains and brawn (but\nmostly brawn) to blast your way\nthrough a variety of dangerous\nground, vehicle and air-based stages.\nAnd if you’re really feeling\ntrigger-happy, you can earn additional\npoints by blowing up the environment.\nEach victory sees your military rank\nrise, earning you increasingly powerful\nand upgradeable weapons.<br>\n<br>\nYou’ll need preternatural reflexes and\na never-say-die spirit to restore peace\nin the ever-volatile Middle East. When\nthe smoke clears, will you be a\nSpecial Operations legend?",
