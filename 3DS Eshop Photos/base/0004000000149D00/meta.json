    "description": "Two sisters escape their fate as\n<br>research subjects and fight to survive\n<br>using aircrafts of war.\n<br>\n<br>Karous -The Beast of Re:Eden- is a\n<br>3D vertical shoot 'em up game. This\n<br>game allows players to design their\n<br>own aircraft by letting them choose\n<br>which weapons and items they take\n<br>with them into battle.\n<br>\n<br>The player's aircraft can use shields,\n<br>different shots, bombs, and swords.\n<br>Each of these will also level up the\n<br>more they're used and increase in\n<br>power. Additional weapons and items\n<br>will unlock as the player progresses,\n<br>as well.\n<br>\n<br>Karous -The Beast of Re:Eden-\n<br>features over 100 missions to\n<br>complete along with a number of\n<br>achievements in addition to boss\n<br>battles.\n<br>\n<br>Unlike other, traditional shooting\n<br>games, Karous' mission system gives\n<br>the player the freedom to follow\n<br>multiple, branching paths which can\n<br>lead to different endings.",
