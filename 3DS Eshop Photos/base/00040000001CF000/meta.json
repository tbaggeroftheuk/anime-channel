    "description": "Bonus:\n<br>Download code for Knight's Bell for YO-KAI WATCH BLASTERS®: White Dog Squad for Nintendo 3DS.\n<br>\n<br>Players can team up with up to three other friends either locally or online to fight towering Big Bosses, using skills and powerful Soultimate Moves. While previous YO-KAI WATCH games focused on turn-based battles, YO-KAI WATCH BLASTERS drops you into real-time skirmishes, in the first ever action RPG for the series. \n<br>\n<br>During these battles, you directly control your Yo-kai as you strategise with different skills and equipment to defeat huge bosses. By taking on various fast-paced missions, players will embark on a journey to meet, befriend and battle more than 400 new and returning Yo-kai.\n<br>\n<br>Each of the two versions of the game – YO-KAI WATCH BLASTERS: White Dog Squad or YO-KAI WATCH BLASTERS: Red Cat Corps – contains different Yo-kai, missions and bosses. By trading between the two, you can collect all the Yo-kai!",
