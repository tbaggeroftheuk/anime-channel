Each stage has a\nmusical track that must be used as a\nguide to perform specific moves such\nas hitting enemies, jumping gaps and\nstriking musical plants in the\nbackground. Thanks to the game’s\nintuitive two-button control system,\npicking up the basics is really simple…\nbut that doesn’t mean that saving\nPrincess Ariana from the Noizoids is\ngoing to be easy!",
