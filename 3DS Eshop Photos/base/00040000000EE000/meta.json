    "description": "Famous names from favourite\n<br>Nintendo franchises and guest\n<br>characters come together in a\n<br>portable fighter filled with spectacular\n<br>action. With unique modes, online\n<br>multiplayer, the ability to customise\n<br>your fighter and the series’ biggest\n<br>roster of playable fighters ever, Super\n<br>Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS is truly\n<br>a clash for the ages!\n<br><br/>\n<br>The basics of Super Smash Bros. are\n<br>simple. Use your chosen character’s\n<br>unique attacks and special moves to\n<br>damage your opponent, then hit ‘em\n<br>with a smash attack to send them\n<br>flying off the stage! The higher your\n<br>opponent’s damage – represented as a\n<br>percentage – the farther they’ll fly\n<br>when launched, so pummel away until\n<br>you see them steaming, then unleash\n<br>your strongest smash attack and\n<br>watch your target skyrocket off the\n<br>stage! Take on nearby challengers in\n<br>local multiplayer, or bring the battle\n<br>to faraway friends and foes in online\n<br>matches.\n<br><br/>\n<br>Visit amiibo.nintendo.eu for\n<br>compatible amiibo™ and the latest\n<br>information.
