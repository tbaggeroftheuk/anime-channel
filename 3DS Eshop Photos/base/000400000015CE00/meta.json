    "description": "Gunman Clive returns in an all new\n<br>adventure. Now in Colour!\n<br>\n<br>After rescuing Ms Johnson, Gunman\n<br>Clive returns to again find the town\n<br>under attack by bandits. To stop them\n<br>once and for all he must chase after\n<br>their leader; an adventure that takes\n<br>him all the way around the world,\n<br>facing bigger and deadlier enemies\n<br>than ever before.\n<br>\n<br>Gunman Clive 2 retains the same\n<br>classic gameplay formula, but dials\n<br>the action up a notch further, with\n<br>improved and more colourful graphics,\n<br>more dynamic levels and richer, more\n<br>diverse environments, bigger bosses\n<br>and tons of new enemies.",
