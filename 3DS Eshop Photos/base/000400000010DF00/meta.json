    "description": "Squids Odyssey is a unique mix of action strategy and RPG: build your\n<br>team of Squid heroes for epic turn-based battles against corrupted\n<br>crabs and shrimps! Steev and the rest of the Squids are in danger! An\n<br>infectious black ooze is corrupting their world. The band of unlikely\n<br>heroes need to fight back to save their kingdoms! Squids Odyssey is not\n<br>just about gorgeous cartoon art, jaunty music and humorous\n<br>storytelling, the battles provide a deep challenge as strategy and skill\n<br>are required to use the environment, the Squids’ strengths and enemies’\n<br>weaknesses to victory!",
