    "description": "The Celtic legend of Dire Grove has been passed down from generation to generation for centuries.\n<br>\n<br>Considered a fairytale, its telling was common at campfires and as a bedtime story meant to frighten small children into staying in their beds through the night. However, a recently unearthed artifact in the United Kingdom corroborates the legend and so begins a journey of survival for a small band of graduate students in the secluded resort of Dire Grove.",
