    "description": "There's something terribly wrong in\n<br>an alternate dimension! Help Captain\n<br>Viridian flip to find five crew members,\n<br>20 hard-to-reach Trinkets and save a\n<br>dimension on the brink of destruction.\n<br>It's a space opera in the most unique\n<br>scale with a style that only VVVVVV\n<br>can bring to you. Instead of jumping,\n<br>control the direction of gravity by\n<br>inverting your gravity and allowing\n<br>Captain Viridian to flip between the\n<br>floors and ceilings of the\n<br>environments.\n<br>\n<br>For adventurers who save the\n<br>dimension, there's still hours and\n<br>hours of new gameplay with all-new\n<br>Player Levels. Test your mettle and\n<br>see if you have what it takes to beat a\n<br>collection of levels created by other\n<br>famous game developers. Inspired by\n<br>classic 8-bit days gone-by and now\n<br>with experience-heightening 3D,\n<br>VVVVVV will challenge even the most\n<br>battle-hardened old-school gamers.",
