    "description": "\"Mercenaries Saga 3\" is a tactical\n<br>RPG set in a fantasy world.\n<br>\n<br>Battles take place on an isometric\n<br>grid, requiring you to move characters\n<br>and take advantage of terrain in order\n<br>to be successful.\n<br>\n<br>Story\n<br>\n<br>Long ago there were two continents,\n<br>split into north and south by a large\n<br>ocean. These two continents under\n<br>went vastly different development.\n<br>\n<br>In the north continent, the Flare\n<br>Kingdom, with their advanced industry\n<br>and powerful military background,\n<br>expanded their sphere of influence.\n<br>They annexed neighboring states until\n<br>the entire north continent was under\n<br>their control.\n<br>\n<br>On the other hand, the tribes of the\n<br>Kirialos country in the southern\n<br>continent were at constant war over\n<br>their plentiful resources.\n<br>\n<br>Having achieved domination of their\n<br>own continent, the Flare Kingdom set\n<br>their sights on Kirialos's resources.\n<br>\n<br>The Flare Kingdom intervened in the\n<br>wars on the south continent in the\n<br>name of peacekeeping, but took\n<br>complete control in the blink of an\n<br>eye.\n<br>\n<br>The Flare Kingdom set up a puppet\n<br>government in Kirialos, whilst\n<br>syphoning the wealth obtained from its\n<br>resources back to their own continent.\n<br>\n<br>That's when the \"Liberation Army\"\n<br>appeared - it's sights set on\n<br>overthrowing the Kingdom and its\n<br>puppet government.\n<br>\n<br>To deal with this uprising, the\n<br>Kingdom set up a local ministry of\n<br>war. The name of the Kingdom's\n<br>foreign campaign regiment was\n<br>\"Coronea\"â€•\n<br>\n<br>The mercenaries who joined this unit,\n<br>be it for money, fame or honor,\n<br>became known as the \"Kingdom's\n<br>Dogs\". This is where their story begins.",
