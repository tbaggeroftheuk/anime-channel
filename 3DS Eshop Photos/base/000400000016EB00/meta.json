    "description": "Ash is a classic turn-based RPG, featuring a massive, fully-realized world with lush visuals, and a wonderfully compelling story. \n<br>\n<br>These are strange days for Aghaus. By order of the Magistrate, the Royal Guard is to assemble for deployment in two daysâ€™ time. It has been years since I last left the capital, and further still that I can remember such a command being issued! But what need is there for a Royal Guard, when no King sits upon the throne? Though my oath binds me to his service, the Magistrate is not my liege. He rules in the absence of a rightful heir. \n<br>\n<br>My men await their orders; they too are uneasy. It is for their sake that I stay my tongue, and place my faith in the Almighty that my fears are unfounded. \n<br>\n<br>Tomorrow, we make for the East.",
