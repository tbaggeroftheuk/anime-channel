    "description": "Cave Story takes you into a rare world where a curious race of innocent rabbit-like creatures, called Mimiga, run free. \n<br><br>\nYou wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you're in such a place. While uncovering the Mimiga Village, you discover that the once-carefree Mimiga are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist.\n<br><br>\nTheir only hope rests squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't remember his own name. Take control and learn the origins of this worldâ€™s power, stop the delusional villain and save the Mimiga!",
