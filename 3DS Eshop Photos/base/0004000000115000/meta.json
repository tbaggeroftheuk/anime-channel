    "description": "From the mind of comedian Yoshiyuki\nHirai comes WEAPON SHOP de\nOMASSE, a humorous twist on the\nclassic fantasy adventure.\n<br/><br/>\nYou are Yuhan, an apprentice in a\nweapon rental shop inside an RPG.\nIt’s your job to forge and rent\nweapons to the seven misfit heroes\nand various NPCs that come your\nway.\n<br/><br/>\nWhy rental? Sure, there’s a risk that\na hero will fail their quest and lose\nyour weapon, but if they succeed,\nyou’ll get your weapon back, get\npaid, and earn a returning customer.\nWith the dreaded Evil Lord’s return\nlooking nigh, it wouldn’t hurt to have\nmore well-equipped heroes running\naround, either.\n<br/><br/>\nMatch your customer to a weapon\nand forge it to the rhythm! Tap your\nNintendo 3DS in time with the music,\nbalance the heat of your materials,\nand make sure that your hammer\nstrikes true to create a weapon that\nreally shines.\n<br/><br/>\nFollow your customers’ adventures\non the “Grindcast,” a special feed built\ninto each weapon that sends every\nencounter, discovery, and\nconversation it hears back to you!",
