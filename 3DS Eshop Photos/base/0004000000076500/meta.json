    "description": "Luigi is back on a mission to remove\n<br>a bunch of stubborn ghosts from some\n<br>super-spooky mansions in Luigi’s\n<br>Mansion 2 for Nintendo 3DS. Armed\n<br>with his trusty “Poltergust”\n<br>ghost-grabbing vacuum cleaner,\n<br>Mario’s brother takes centre stage to\n<br>capture those pesky phantoms. Sure,\n<br>Luigi’s the nervous type who’d rather\n<br>be as far from these ghosts as he can\n<br>get, but a reluctant hero can still save\n<br>the day!\n<br>\n<br>This hair-raising title is the first\n<br>sequel to the 2002\n<br>Nintendo GameCube launch title,\n<br>Luigi’s Mansion, and brings back all\n<br>the thrills of the original with bags of\n<br>new fun features too. The\n<br>stereoscopic 3D visuals bring the\n<br>murky mansions, ghastly ghosts and\n<br>spooky surroundings to life, so you\n<br>can experience all the haunting chills\n<br>and supernatural fun the game has to\n<br>offer.",
