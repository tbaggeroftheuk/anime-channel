    "description": "Mario™ and friends invite you to be their party guest! Think fast and have a blast in this free version of the Mario Party Star Rush game. Connect with a player that has the full version to enjoy all multiplayer modes with up to 4 players. No matter how you party, it’s instant fun for everyone!\n<br>\nBreak free of turn order and choose your path across bite-sized, open maps in Toad Scramble. You and up to 3 friends roll the dice, roam the board, and recruit fan-favorite allies, like Yoshi™, Daisy™, and Waluigi™! The bigger your party, the faster you can earn stars and coins in frantic minigames. Pit your skills against friends by racing through minigames in Coinathlon or navigating a board in Balloon Bash. As you play multiplayer, single-player bonuses unlock, including Goomba Gold Rush, which has you blasting enemies with cannons, and a museum you can add characters to by tapping compatible amiibo™ figures. Partying is tough business!",
