    "description": "Defend Your Crypt is a strategy and puzzle game, in which we will have to avoid to lose our treasure by the tomb thieves.\n<br>We, as the Pharaoh, can use different traps to defeat those damn ambitious humans who are profaning your tomb.\n<br>\n<br>Retro style:\n<br>Like many of our games, Defend Your Crypt will have retro pixel art. In addition, we will lean toward Egyptian style.\n<br>\n<br>Trap variety:\n<br>The game will contain classic traps such as open platforms, which can make robbers fall onto spikes, and also water traps or killer scorpions and beetles.\n<br>\n<br>Gore:\n<br>In Ratalaika Games, we know you like blood, so we have included it. A lot of it. Killing the robbers won’t be enough.\n<br>\"If it bleeds, we can kill it\", and we’re taking it to the limit. (If you don’t like blood, you can deactivate it)\n<br>\n<br>Levels:\n<br>A large number of levels to make sure the robbers will not steal any of your gold, and you enjoy the game to the fullest.\n<br>A lot of time can be spent on finishing all of them!",
