    "description": "Cross a busy road avoiding the traffic, dart across train lines missing the speeding trains and leap across gushing rivers on moving logs. One mistake and it's game over.\n<br>\n<br>Move your character one step at a time knowing that one wrong step means certain death. Reach each designated checkpoint on your life-or-death journey and then find the goal to clear the stage. Make use of footbridges and invincibility stars to bypass certain-death points or use your character's special skill such as slow motion or walking on water to cheat death. \n<br>\n<br>There are four playable characters to choose from, each with their own skill that can be used a certain number of times in each stage. \n<br>\n<br>Try your skill on two game modes.\n<br>Goal Run Mode challenges you to reach each checkpoint and then the goal.\n<br>Survival Run Mode tests your survival skills as you dodge traffic on a bustling highway and over train lines for 60 seconds!",
