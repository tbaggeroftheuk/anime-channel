In this enhanced version, view Solvalou from a mid-air perspective, gauging incoming fire from down below while the scenery and aerial enemies fly on by! Pilot the advanced fighter-bomber through 16 hazardous areas and destroy as many targets as possible. Annihilate the Andor Genesis for extra points and earn a place in the High Scores! The age-old question stands for the long-time and new fans of this arcade classic--are you devious enough to beat Xevious?",
