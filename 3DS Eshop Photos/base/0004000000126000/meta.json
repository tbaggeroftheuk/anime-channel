Line up three\nPokémon in a row to clear your\nPokémon from the box, and to attack\nand reduce the HP of the wild\nPokémon that you face. When its HP\nreaches zero, you will be able to Link\nthat Pokémon!\n<br/><br/>\nAs time passes, the wild Pokémon\nwill also lash out to attack you in\nreturn. When you’re attacked by a\nwild Pokémon, the Link Box will lose\nsome of its energy. The wild Pokémon\nyou face may even try to get in your\nway! If the Link Box’s energy reaches\nzero, it’s game over.\n<br/><br/>\nPokémon Link: Battle! features all\n718 Pokémon discovered to date,\nincluding those that just debuted in\nPokémon X and Pokémon Y.
