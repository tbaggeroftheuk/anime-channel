    "description": "There are so many surprises, thrills, and laughs in store for Mario and Luigi that it isn’t even funny…except it is! Every hoo-hoo, hee-hee, and ha-ha in this classic RPG adventure has been remade for Nintendo 3DS™ systems. Plus, an all-new squad-based strategy tie-in sees Bowser’s Minions on a quest to stop Fawful. “Have you readiness for this?!?”\n<br>\n<br>Sure you do! So guide the Bros. on a journey through the Beanbean Kingdom to recover the stolen voice of Princess Peach. Every step on your path and every stomp on a Goomba has been completely recreated with enhanced graphics, lighting, and new gameplay options. Take down enemies using special Bros. Attacks and solve puzzles with Bros. Actions. Do you have fury? Especially due to Fawful? Then go behind the scenes of this superstar saga by captaining an army of Bowser’s minions. With 50+ minions to recruit, strategy is on your side!",
