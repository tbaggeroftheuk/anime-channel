The Nintendo 3DS allows for the realization of simple and easy-to-play operability.<br>\n\"Heyawake\" is a puzzle in which you fill in the spaces according to the rules.<br>\nIt's called \"Heyawake\" (\"split rooms\") because the board is divided into rooms. This puzzle first appeared in 1992, but a plethora of solutions has been developed, allowing for a very progressive puzzle. Each time you discover a new strategic move, your problem-solving skills will improve. To ensure your long-term enjoyment, we've prepared both a \"Stage Clear\" mode and a \"Random\" mode.
