Each player controls a Mech with the aim to shoot at a giant ball, and try to get it into the other team’s goal to score. Matches are three vs. three multiplayer matches, and the first team to get three points ahead of the other, or the team with the most points after five minutes wins. Three different kinds of item will appear at random during the match, and using them at the right time is the key to victory. Intuitive controls and simple rules make this an easy game to pick up and play.<br><br>Visit amiibo.nintendo.eu for compatible amiibo™ and the latest information.
