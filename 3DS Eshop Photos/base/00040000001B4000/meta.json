    "description": "As of late March 2023, it will no longer be possible to make purchases in Nintendo eShop for Nintendo 3DS, including add-on content for this game. For more information please visit Support.\n<br><br>\nIn a continent that was torn asunder by warring gods, guide two armies through brutal tactical battles—as this reimagined RPG epic invades the West! Uncover the intertwining stories of Alm and Celica, engage foes, fend off dragons, and explore 3D dungeons. Your prowess will grow as you master this melding of modern and legacy Fire Emblem™ gameplay.\n<br>\n<br>Alm and Celica lead separate armies united by a common goal: to stop the war and unify Valentia. Each army has its own path, units, and supplies, so balance their needs. Here, battle is waged in the traditions of elder Fire Emblem™ games, when the rules of battle were simpler, yet the challenge formidable as ever. When you encounter a dungeon, explore it in action-adventure style: smash false walls, break pots, or ambush enemies with a slash of your sword. You never know; you may stumble upon some uncommon items…or a hidden tactical battle with a brutal boss.\n<br>\n<br>Build up your army with purchasable downloadable content. Some packs let you farm for items, experience, or in-game currency, while others offer more story content or add new characters.",
