In Horseshoe Crab Rescue!, you will help out these amazing creatures by flipping horseshoe crabs that have gotten stranded on their backs. Hurry around the beach and try to rescue as many horseshoe crabs as you can before time runs out!\n<br>\n<br>Horseshoe Crab Rescue! is a casual game with light educational elements.
