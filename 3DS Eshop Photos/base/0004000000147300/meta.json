    "description": "Build a tower higher and higher by\n<br>stacking objects of all shapes and\n<br>sizes together in any way you can.\n<br>Balance telephone boxes, road cones,\n<br>televisions, desks, chairs, curling\n<br>stones - more than 100 in total - in a\n<br>giant pile to reach the goal line. Build\n<br>past mutant birds, hurricane winds and\n<br>black holes sent by the evil Crash\n<br>Construction Company as they try to\n<br>bring your tower crashing down.\n<br>\n<br>Pile household objects high enough\n<br>to reach the goal line and hold it for\n<br>three seconds without it collapsing to\n<br>complete each floor. If your\n<br>construction is too weak it'll topple\n<br>over and come crashing to the ground.\n<br>\n<br>Follow the story of the Haruno\n<br>Construction Company and their Sky\n<br>High Construction Project to build a\n<br>tower to the moon in the name of\n<br>justice!",
