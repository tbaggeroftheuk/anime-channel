    "description": "Become one of the world’s best tiny robot helpers by doing your part to open a new museum. Collect Happy Points by vaccuming, picking up trash, and helping a cast of colorful characters, and then use those Happy Points to purchase special film that lets you photograph real-world objects and transport them into the game for the museum’s displays!\n<br><br>\nMr. Curator wants to immortalize objects from your day-to-day life, and it’s Chibi-Robo’s job to collect them! Lead Chibi-Robo on a scavenger hunt, taking photos of real-world objects with the Nintendo 3DS Camera so that he can transport them into his world for the museum’s collection.\n<br><br>\nAlong the way, you’ll meet eclectic characters who need Chibi Robo’s help, like a sushi-slinging squid, a high-flying super hero, and an eccentric pair of chefs. The more happiness you spread, the faster your quest for exhibits can progress. Just make sure Chibi-Robo doesn’t run out of watts. He’s a tiny robot, after all.",
