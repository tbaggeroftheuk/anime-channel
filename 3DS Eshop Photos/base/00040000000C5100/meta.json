    "description": "Picdun is back, now better than ever! And this time, you can explore as a couple!\n<br><br>\nPicdun 2: Witch's Curse is a 3D dungeon RPG set in the mysterious dungeon called \"Picdun.\" Choose your partner from three female adventurers--the Archer, the Whipper and the Spellcaster--and venture into the depths of the dungeon together. Sixty stages await you, filled with a wide variety of puzzles ranging from easy to mind-bendingly difficult!\n<br><br>\nPlaces you go are mapped automatically, and once you cover all the tiles on a floor you will complete the picture hidden underneath.\nAs in the previous game, battles feature a large number of dynamic and powerful enemies. The hero is unable to attack due to the Witch's Curse, so he must protect his partner with a shield and guide her to attack by chopping down or slashing sideways. Also, you can trigger a power move by raising the shield at the same time as an enemy attack.\n<br><br>\nExplore the depths of the dungeon to uncover the mystery of the Witch's Curse!",
