Can you guide him in the\nright direction by digging through the\nearth to collect the gems and nuggets\nof gold? Work out your path carefully\nas you push rocks out of the way or\nyou could find Dan caught in one of\nthe many traps.

Some of the\ncaves you encounter are flooded with\nwater forcing you to plan your route\nmore carefully so that you don’t run\nout of air. Use cameras to take\nsnapshots of the level, then if you\nmake mistakes or get trapped, you\ncan use your snapshot as a restart\npoint.\n<br/><br/>\nCan you become a gold star player?\nChallenge yourself to complete the\ncave, beat the timer and collect the\nhidden secret gem on every level.\n<br/><br/>\nFeatures:<br/>\n* Four themed areas graded as\ntraining, beginner, advanced and\nexpert.<br/>\n* Stereoscopic 3D layering<br/>\n* Completely revamped graphics<br/>\n* Improved sound effects<br/>\n* High score tables for every level<br/>\n* 4 save slots – challenge your\nfamily to beat your scores<br/>\n* 60fps smooth action",
