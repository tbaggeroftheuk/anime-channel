    "description": "Never before released in North America, this long-awaited entry in the acclaimed Devil Summoner series takes players into a future in which technology and other worldly forces meet in a macabre fusion of cyberpunk futurism and gothic horror. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>A first-person sci-fi RPG epic, Soul Hackers tells of a city held up as a beacon of humanity's triumph of technology, but with an infernal secret.  In this would-be utopia, a group of hackers takes on a centuries-old mystic society, and a battle for control over humanity's fate is about to begin...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>In a society originated from a bizarre marriage of technology and demonology, an unleashed evil-borne of an inconvenient truth-threatens to bring an end not just to the deceptive harmony, but to mankind itself. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Improved graphics marry with extensive voice acting, a host of technical enhancements, and 3D dungeon exploration to make Soul Hackers a natural fit to the Nintendo 3DS.",
