    "description": "A legend handed down through the\nages says that the Cocoro Islands\nwere created by the god Perfect. He\nbreathed his spirit into them and,\nthrough his will alone, each one\nreceived a founding entity. These\nfounding entities had extraordinary\npowers that were to be used for the\ngood of Cocoro; the Yoko were their\nprotectors. And that is the incredible\nstory weâ€™re going to tell you...\n<br/><br/>\nCocoro is a strategy game where you\ncontrol the Yoko of each of the four\nelements. In this typically Asiatic\ngame world, you must unlock heroes\nwith different characteristics and an\narray of weapons you can upgrade\nthroughout the battles.",
