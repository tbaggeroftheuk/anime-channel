Duck and dodge your way through each stage, avoiding collisions that will damage and eventually break your shell and spoil the egg! Reach the goal as quickly as possible and without breaking the egg's shell!\n<br><br>\nEarn Egg Points for making it through each stage and extra points for accomplishing a task. Use your Egg Points to enhance your egg's HP, Speed and Shell.\n<br><br>\nCollect the chicks scattered throughout each stage to increase your rate of hatching.
