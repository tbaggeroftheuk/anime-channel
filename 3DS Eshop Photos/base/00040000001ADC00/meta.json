    "description": "New tanks! New gimmicks! And two players at the same time!\n<br>The 3D Tank Battle Game is fully loaded with new features!\n<br>Steer your tank with the slide pad whilst intuitively aiming and firing with the touch screen, battles have never been more action packed!\n<br>\n<br>This time there are two tanks, Offensive and Evasive types.\n<br>The Offensive type can charge up energy to fire off a Barrier Bomb, a special move that not only destroys your enemies but also any bullets they've fired!\n<br>The Evasive type can use up its energy to hover in the air, dodging all enemy fire whilst being able to fire back itself! It's invincible!\n<br>The enemy tanks also have new equipment of their own.\n<br>Elusive Warp Tanks, floating mines flying on to the screen, fixed battery guns with unique bullet variations, and Super Boss Tanks are all making their first appearance!\n<br>In addition, there are machines that can call additional enemy tanks to the battlefield, completely changing the flow of play! Destroying these machines quickly is the key to victory.\n<br>\n<br>There are 90 stages in all. (50 Normal Stages + 40 Extra Stages.)\n<br>New in this game is local multiplayer. Now two players can go through the excitement of clearing stages together!\n<br>If you clear all the stages together, you can try out playing the new Combat Mode.",
