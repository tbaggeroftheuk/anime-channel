    "description": "Think you know Donkey Kong? Think again! This Game Boy version takes the arcade classic to a new level, with 101 unique stages of platforming perfection.\n\nLike the original, Mario must rescue Pauline from DK’s clutches; but beyond the initial arcade-style stages lies a whole new experience. In each new action-puzzle themed level, Mario must dodge traps, avoid enemies and hit switches, to bring the key to the exit.\n\nLuckily Mario has learned some new moves, too, like the handstand and backflip; and he’ll need all his skills to contend with Donkey Kong in the numerous boss battles. Go teach that ape some manners, Mario!",
