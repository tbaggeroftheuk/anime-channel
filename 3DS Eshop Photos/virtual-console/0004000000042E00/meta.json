    "description": "If you prefer long-distance battles, choose Game A to strategically deploy your fleet and engage the enemy in a pulse-pouding missile face-off. Find and sink your enemy's vessels before your opponent finds and sinks yours! Or if face-to-face battles are more your forte, choose Game B, climb into your fleet's submarine, and set off to face your opponent's fleet head-on. Use your sub's sonar to track enemy movements from beneath the waves, then surface to attack. But keep in mind, while you're hunting the enemy, your enemy's sub is hunting you...\n<br><br>\nNo matter what you choose, it's up to you to lead your fleet to victory!",
