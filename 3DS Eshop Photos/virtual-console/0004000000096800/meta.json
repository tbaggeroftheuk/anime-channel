    "description": "Dr. Eggman (AKA Dr. Robotnik) has tricked Sonic into wearing a pair of magical sneakers that prevent him from running at super-sonic speeds. The only things that can remove these sluggish shoes and restore Sonic's speed are the Chaos Emeralds hidden within Dr. Eggman’s Super Labyrinth.\n<br><br>\nSpin through four labyrinth zones, each containing three regular stages and a Boss stage. Seek out square warp gates to find special items, and earn extra lives by grabbing 100 rings in Bonus stages. Find the Chaos Emeralds before time runs out!",
