    "description": "This Super NES version of the popular ‘picture crossword’ game was originally released only in Japan and features hundreds of relaxing yet challenging brainteasers.\n<br>\n<br>Each Picross puzzle consists of a numbered grid of tiles which reveal a picture when correctly chiselled away. In Mario’s main mode, a wrong move means losing time. However, in the more difficult Wario mode, mistakes are not shown... so be careful!",
