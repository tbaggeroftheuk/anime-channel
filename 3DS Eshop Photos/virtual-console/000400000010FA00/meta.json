The journey is perilous, as the Great Devil’s fortress is guarded by a massive army. But Lolo has a few tricks up his sleeve! He can move blocks to trap enemies, clear a path, or use as a shield. He can also activate the Magic Shot that will turn enemies into eggs. But watch out as a single touch from these creatures could spell trouble for our hero!
