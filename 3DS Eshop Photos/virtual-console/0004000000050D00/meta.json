    "description": "Chalk up, and get ready for some cool pool action! Stroke a mean cue, and you might just work your way to the big time in the Pocket Competition. Execute consecutive shots, sink by numerical order, and perform amazing trick shots such as mass√©s and jumps for a chance to earn additional points or shots. If you manage to sink a ball in a pocket marked with a star, you'll get a chance for bonuses!\n\nTest your billiard skills in two great modes! Pocket offers the traditional 16-ball game, and 9-Ball is a more contemporary version of the sport but still quite the challenge!",
