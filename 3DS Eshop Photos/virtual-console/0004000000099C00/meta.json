This classic simulation lets you\n<br>get hands-on with every aspect of\n<br>farm life: from sowing crops to raising\n<br>animals. The harder you work, the\n<br>bigger and better your farm will\n<br>become.\n<br>\n<br>You can also visit the town to buy\n<br>supplies; from food and drink to keep\n<br>up your strength, to labour-saving\n<br>tools for making life easier.\n<br>\n<br>Short on time? Let the Harvest\n<br>Sprites tend to your farm while your\n<br>Nintendo 3DS™ system is switched\n<br>off!",
