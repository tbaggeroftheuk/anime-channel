    "description": "When the Mega Man series made the technological leap from NES to Super Nintendo, so too did Mega Man himself.\n<br>\n<br>Set one hundred years after the original hero's adventures, Mega Man X stars a more powerful generation of robot known as X who - along with the maverick Zero - must take on a new threat: the reploids.\n<br>\n<br>Like Mega Man, X must battle through each thrilling stage and defeat the boss, to capture its weapon for his own. But unlike Mega Man, X can dash, climb walls and collect armour to upgrade his abilities!\n<br>\n<br>This is the US version of the game.",
