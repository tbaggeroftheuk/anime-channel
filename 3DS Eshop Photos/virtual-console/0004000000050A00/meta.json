    "description": "Give Chef Peter Pepper a helping hand in creating the ultimate hamburger! Each hamburger ingredient is located on a different platform, and the chef must climb through a series of ladders in order to reach them. Walk across the ingredient to drop it closer to the waiting plate down below. Once all of the burgers have been completed, you’ll be able to move on to the next level! But watch out! Renegade ingredients will stop at nothing to put an end to our chef’s cooking days!  Dodge them, stun them using pepper, or drop a hamburger ingredient on top of them to stop their chase! If you run out of pepper, collect bonus foods such as coffee, chocolate, or fries to recharge! It’s a non-stop food-fight in this classic arcade game!",
