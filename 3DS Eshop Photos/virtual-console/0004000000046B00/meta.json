Secret agents Masato Kanzaki and Mizuki Makimura have been dispatched to infiltrate the fortress, and venture to the heart of the complex to destroy it. Masato and Mizuki each have their own abilities, so they will need to tag-team their way to breach the enemies' defenses.\n<br><br>\nJoin these two in their mission through the Fortified Zone, and destroy the threat!",
