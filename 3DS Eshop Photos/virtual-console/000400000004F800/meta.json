    "description": "Mind-bending action awaits you in this classic puzzle game. Catboy and Catgirl have been trapped in an underground labyrinth crawling with monsters. In order to reverse the curse and return to their human form, they must solve all 100 puzzles set out before them. Push blocks, climb ladders, and dig through loose ground to defeat the monsters, and clear each stage. If you make a mistake, simply use the \"rewind\" function and try again! You can even take a break from the main game to create your own puzzles with the level editor. Whether it is maze building or maze solving, it's up to you to help Catboy and Catgirl escape the labyrinth and get out of the curse's reach.",
