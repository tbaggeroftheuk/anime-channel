    "description": "Released on Game Boy in 1990, this\nversion of QIX has not lost its appeal!<br>\n<br>\nQIX is an acclaimed arcade classic in\nwhich your goal is to capture areas of\nthe playing field by drawing Stix\n(lines) with your marker. Capture the\nplaying field step by step by drawing\nmore and more closed shapes, but\navoid the unpredictably moving,\nsticklike Qix and the Sparx traversing\nthe edges.<br>\n<br>\nPerform well enough and you might\neven see Mario, Luigi and Princess\nPeach make an appearance!<br>\n<br>\nThis version of the game does not\nhave multiplayer functionality.",
