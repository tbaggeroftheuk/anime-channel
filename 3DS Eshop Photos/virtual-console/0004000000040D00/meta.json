If he \nconnects, your outfield backs up to\nsnag a fly. A sturdy infield backs you\nup on grounders and pop-ups. \nThree outs later and your team is up. \nTake a strike to feel out the pitcher. \nThen drive a long one. \nIt's a home run! <br>\n<br>\nYou can even choose between \nAmerican or Japanese-style modes.<br>\n<br>\nThis version of the game does not\nhave multiplayer functionality.",
