    "description": "Dr. Robotnik has tricked Sonic into\nwearing a pair of magical sneakers\nthat prevent Sonic from running at\nsuper-sonic speeds. Sonic thought\nquickly though: \"These sneakers keep\nmy feet from moving fast, but they\nwon't slow down my Super Spin\nDash!\" The only thing that can restore\nSonic's speed are the Chaos Emeralds\nhidden in Dr. Robotnik's super\nlabyrinth. Help Sonic find the Chaos\nEmeralds before his time runs out as\nhe spins through four Labyrinth zones,\neach containing three regular stages\nand a Boss stage.<br>\n<br>\n-Step into special sneakers to make\nyou run faster. But hurry, the power\nonly lasts a short time<br>\n<br>\n-Use square warp gates to help you\nfind special items<br>\n<br>\n-Grab 100 rings in the bonus stage\nto win an extra try",
