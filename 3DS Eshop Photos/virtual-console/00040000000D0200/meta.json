    "description": "Developed by Naxat Soft for their\nSummer Carnival tournament in 1992,\nRECCA is a fast, furious shooter that\npushed the NES™ to\nnever-before-seen speeds.\n<br/><br/>\nBattle through stages swarming with\nenemies, collecting power-ups for\nyour primary and secondary weapons.\nHold fire for a moment and plasma\nenergy will build up, to be used as a\nshield or launched as a plasma bomb.\n<br/><br/>\nEven RECCA’s soundtrack is hard\ncore, with some of the most\nimpressive music on the NES. This\ntour de force of technical wizardry\nand intense action is not for the\nfaint-hearted!",
