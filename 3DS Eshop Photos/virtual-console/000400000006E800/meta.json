    "description": "Bowser™ and the Koopalings are causing chaos yet again, but this time they’re going beyond the Mushroom Kingdom into the seven worlds that neighbor it. Now Mario™ and Luigi™ must battle a variety of enemies, including a Koopaling in each unique and distinctive world, on their way to ultimately taking on Bowser himself. Lucky for the brothers, they have more power-ups available than ever before. \n<br><br>\nFly above the action using the Super Leaf, swim faster by donning the Frog Suit, or defeat enemies using the Hammer Bros. Suit. Use the brand-new overworld map to take the chance to play a minigame in hopes of gaining extra lives or to find a Toad’s House where you can pick up additional items. All this (and more) combines into one of gaming’s most well-known and beloved titles—are you ready to experience gaming bliss? ",
