Take them on one by one, starting with skinny Glass Joe. Battle up through King Hippo and all the way to the WVBA Champion himself. Players use their best jabs, hooks, and power uppercuts to knock out opponents but must also dodge jaw-breaking blows by paying attention to subtle changes in their\nfoe's body position.
